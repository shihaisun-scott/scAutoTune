\title{Explore PCs on the sample PBMC data}
\usage{
run_pc_elbow_sample(feature_steps = seq(500, 6000, by = 500), max_pcs = 40)
}
\arguments{
\item{feature_steps}{Integer vector of feature counts to try.
Defaults to seq(500, 4000, by = 500).}

\item{max_pcs}{Maximum number of PCs to compute.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
\item pc_df: data frame of variance per PC and feature count
\item elbow_df: data frame for the chosen feature set with fitted curve
\item suggested_pcs: integer suggested PC cut
\item plot: ggplot object of the overlap / elbow plot
}
}
\description{
Uses the bundled pbmc_clustered.rds sample dataset to compute
variance-explained curves for PCs at different numbers of features,
fits a smooth curve, and suggests an "elbow" (optimal PCs).
